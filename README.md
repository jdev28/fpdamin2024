![Streamlit Logo](https://streamlit.io/images/brand/streamlit-logo-secondary-colormark-darktext.svg)

## 📚 **Project Overview**
This project is a **Data Mining Final Project** aimed at analyzing and predicting insights from scraped data on books. Built using **Python** and **Streamlit**, this app provides interactive features for:
- Data scraping.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
- Implementation of machine learning algorithms.
- Comprehensive visualizations and scenario-based insights.

---

## 🚀 **Features**
1. **Scrape Data**:
   - Extracts book data from the [Books to Scrape](https://books.toscrape.com) website.
   - Downloads the scraped data in CSV format.

2. **Visualization**:
   - Visualizes price distribution, rating trends, and correlations between features.

3. **Scenarios**:
   - **Scenario 1**: Predict book prices using Linear Regression and Decision Tree Regression.
   - **Scenario 2**: Predict stock availability with Logistic Regression and Random Forest.
   - **Scenario 3**: Segment books based on price and rating using K-Means and DBSCAN.
   - **Scenario 4**: Predict book prices with KNN and SVM.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Summarizes insights from all scenarios and compares the models' performances.
